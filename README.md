## The Permissionless Launchpad with Built-in Trust

Notty Terminal is a revolutionary permissionless launchpad powered by a Dynamic Reputation System (DRS) that transforms on-chain behavior into quantifiable reputation and trust. In an industry plagued by rugs and scams, Notty creates a transparent ecosystem where every wallet builds a verifiable reputation based on real activity.

## Why Notty Terminal?

### The Problem
The crypto token market suffers from information asymmetry and misaligned incentives:
- Retail investors have no reliable way to evaluate projects or developers
- Quality developers struggle to differentiate themselves from scammers  
- Centralized launchpads act as expensive gatekeepers with manual approvals

### Our Solution
Notty Terminal solves this through:

- ‚úÖ **Incentivized Good Behavior**: Both developers and traders earn reputation by delivering value
- ‚úÖ **Earned Reputation**: On-chain actions automatically adjust DRS scores
- ‚úÖ **Full Permissionlessness**: Anyone can launch a project with no gatekeepers or approvals
- ‚úÖ **Transparent Trust Layer**: Users can see each wallet's history and scores before interacting
